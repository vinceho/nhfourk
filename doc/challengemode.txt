A player asked for a list of differences in challenge mode.  I hadn't
been maintaining one until that point, but now I am:
 * Effective minimum monster difficulty is 1 higher than in normal mode,
   and maximium is 1.25 times as high.
 * Death drops are six times less common than in normal mode.
 * Elemental resistances reduce damage to 1/3, rather than to 0.
 * HP regeneration is slower (for the player).
 * Sleep attacks put you to sleep for longer.
 * Unchargeable rings can be destroyed by lightning, as in vanilla.
 * The chances of AD_DRST, AD_DRDX, and AD_DRCO attacks 
   draining the corresponding attribute are higher.
 * The chance of a c attack starting the stoning process is higher.
 * The chance of an eel wrapping itself around you (to drown you) is higher.
 * Amulet stealing attacks are four times as likely to succeed.
 * Nurse dancing is less effective.
 * Gremlins are more likely to steal properties.
 * Stunning and slowing attacks are twice as likely to affect you.
 * Confusion and drain-energy attacks always succeed against you
   (if MC doesn't block them).
 * Death's touch works slightly differently.
   (NOTE TO SELF:  maybe not as intended.)
 * Quasits are more likely to be invisible (75% vs 25%).
 * Regaining lost levels (via potion of full healing or via prayer)
   works as in vanilla:  you can only ever regain half of them
   (rounded up).  In normal mode, you can regain all of them.
 * The conduct list says you face/faced a greater challenge.
 * There's a score multiplier.
 * Killing anything disqualifies you from entering the quest at
   experience level 1, even if you don't gain a level from it.
 * Scrolls of identify will identify fewer objects on average.
 * A blessed scroll of charging will sometimes work as uncursed.
 * The minimum luck needed to be guaranteed a wish is higher.
 * Odds of failure are higher wishing for cross-aligned artifacts.
 * Charged rings in starting inventory are more likely to be +1
   (rather than a higher enchantment).
 * Charged rings generated at random are slightly more likely to be
   negatively, rather than positively, enchanted.
 * The gift that the Advent Calendar level unlocks on December 24th
   cannot be a scroll of wishing, a magic lamp, a bag of holding, a
   horn of plenty, a magic harp, or an amulet of flying; instead it
   can be a tinning kit, a pair of lenses, a unicorn horn, an oilskin
   sack, an expensive camera, or a bag of tricks.  (The following are
   possible in both normal and challenge modes: fire horn, frost horn,
   magic flute, drum of earthquake, stethoscope, or magic whistle.)
