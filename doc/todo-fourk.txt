▒▒▒
▒▒▒   Unreproducable / Unconformed / Problematic :
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ says he shot a watchman in the face because f1<direction> fired two darts.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * You are now wearing a leather jacket.  The suit will not fit on your body.  (Gnome)
▒▒▒   + Preliminary attempts to reproduce this have failed (but uncovered another bug, which I fixed).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 22:06 <         Tangles > Error: Couldn't load "garden-2.lev" - making a maze.
▒▒▒   I absolutely cannot reproduce this here.  Both versions of the garden work as intended here.
▒▒▒   Additionally, Travis does not report any unexpected problems building them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Throwing food at a starving tame monster should not revert it to peaceful.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Audit impact_drop(), the code wherein objects fall down stairs when
▒▒▒   a thrown object hits the pile.  We think there may be at least
▒▒▒   two bugs in it.  For details, see the log of #nhfourk from
▒▒▒   2016 May 13th, starting at 8:30am.  Pay special attention to
▒▒▒   what we noticed around 9:31.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 05:22 < FIQ > didyou fix tele prompt
▒▒▒   05:29 < FIQ > jonadab: msg not showing until you pick target xy
▒▒▒   05:29 < FIQ > to what poston would you lke to teleport
▒▒▒   The pline() is clearly called before the getpos(), so if this is actually
▒▒▒   happening, the UI must be doing some weird behind-the-scenes cache thing.
▒▒▒   Probably related:
▒▒▒ * 17:26 < hothraxxa+> jonadab: when i try to pay the sk in minetown, i don't get the "Pay whom?" prompt showing. it
▒▒▒                       should be prompting because i have esp and can see other shopkeepers
▒▒▒   17:26 < hothraxxa+> so nothing seems to happen, but it is waiting for me to move the cursor to the sk
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 04:58 <        Mandevil > jonadab: Another suspected bug: I couldn't eat tin from ground.
▒▒▒   04:58 <        Mandevil > jonadab: It just did nothing when I tried.
▒▒▒   04:58 <        Mandevil > jonadab: Eating from inventory was OK.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Orc as a playable race sucks because peaceful orcs spawn in huge groups and get
▒▒▒   terribly in the way all the time.  Also:  flavor-wise, shouldn't orcs generally
▒▒▒   be hostile to each other anyway?
▒▒▒   Oddly, it looks like the lovemask for orcs is 0.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Regarding changing the remaining time on lit objects, see FIQ's e8904cc.
▒▒▒   But I'm pretty sure actually _changing_ the timers is more complicated than that,
▒▒▒   because among other things the timer code relies on their being in order, so then
▒▒▒   you have to sort the linked list...
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Poison spikes crash bug, see #hardfought log from 2017 Apr 11, starting at 15:14 and up to about 15:30 or so.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 08:43 < Mandevil > Hm, also I didn't gain see invisible from stalker when I was invisible.
▒▒▒   08:43 < Mandevil > Why?
▒▒▒   I don't know how to reproduce this.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 02:50 < rumflump > pets are unnecessarily afraid of shallow water,
▒▒▒                      which can block them from getting to the stairs
▒▒▒   I don't understand the AI code well enough to find the right place to fix this.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Monster-carrying-egg crash.  Steps to reproduce: 1. wish for a trice egg.
▒▒▒   2. drop it on a stair.  3. genesis a hill orc.  4. get it to pick up the egg.
▒▒▒   5. make the hill orc escape via the stairs.  6. levelport to follow.  segfault.
▒▒▒   Haven't verified whether this is Fourk-specific.  FIQ did a workaround to
▒▒▒   convert this from segfault to panic(), but we should fix it for real.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 06:01 < Mandevil > jonadab: This looks like a bug:
▒▒▒   06:01 < Mandevil > The tin opens like magic!  You succeed in opening the tin.
▒▒▒   [As of 4.3.0.4, "You succeed in opening the tin." is suppressed there as redundant.]
▒▒▒   06:01 < Mandevil > It smells like dwarves.
▒▒▒   06:01 < Mandevil > <Eat it? [yn]: y>
▒▒▒   06:01 < Mandevil > You consume pickled coyote.
▒▒▒   Which was it, dwarves or coyote?
▒▒▒   Realistically, I don't have any idea how to reproduce this.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 14:08 <  AmyBSOD\dislex > Is it intentional that if a succubus kills me with its melee attack,
▒▒▒                             there is no "The succubus hits you message at all? I just got
▒▒▒                             "You die..." out of the blue.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 15:15 < rumflump > autoexplore killed my pet
▒▒▒   15:16 < rumflump > You displace your Green-elf.  The Green-elf drowns.
▒▒▒   15:17 < rumflump > I think because I was flying, it didn't count water terrain as special
▒▒▒   15:17 < rumflump > *am* flying
▒▒▒   15:18 < rumflump > http://i.imgur.com/mgliT5i.png
▒▒▒   This is probably an NH4 bug, and FIQ thinks it may have found its way into 3.6 as well.
▒▒▒   Eh, I'm going to file this under "autoexplore can get you killed, but you knew that."
▒▒▒   And if somebody implements an autofight feature, I'll say the same about it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 14:46 < rumflump > is unarmed treated as a 2 handed weapon in 4k? http://i.imgur.com/lXOsE8l.png
▒▒▒   14:47 < rumflump > broke weaponless conduct, because I hit w - by rote and didn't notice that it hadn't
▒▒▒                      worked. looks like I can remove the shield, wield unarmed, and then put the shield
▒▒▒                      back on though
▒▒▒   At this time, I cannot reproduce this issue, even when the shield is cursed.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒   4.3.0.4:
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Differentiate ancient dragons in DawnHack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 10:36 <  AmyBSOD\dislex > Oh, and on an unrelated note, trying to move into an undiggable
▒▒▒                             wall as a scurrier seems to produce no message at all.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒   4.3.0.5 (before save-compat-freeze) :
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 20:53 < aosdict > jonadab: also, monsters generating in (not inaccessible) closets could be a part of your
▒▒▒                     plan to increase monster generation on level creation and decrease the normal generation rate
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 10:45 < FIQ > jonadab: 8ff02c11d9979497396d4921bf0d7cf81808c5d1 3.6.1 commit might be relevant for you
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider FIQ's changes to spellbook mechanics, 5f81af2.  Be advised this will absolutely
▒▒▒   necessitate a fullwise balance check on spellbook availability.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider whether FIQ's more-binary-save-checkpoints change might should be cherry-picked.
▒▒▒   commits 1117745, e7c193d
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Redo the colors for the Dawnlike tiles for all the keys,
▒▒▒   and maybe the violet potion as well.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 23:38 < FIQ > jonadab: shouldn't earth E be always-peaceful to gnomes?
▒▒▒   Yes, but this should go in after the rodent change.  So => 4.3.0.5
▒▒▒   (It'll be a special case in peace_minded().)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check monster (and pet) key usage to make sure it accounts for my multiple-key-types change.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * With regard to add_erosion_words:
▒▒▒   08:25 < FIQ > ou forgot rotproof for wood
▒▒▒   08:25 < FIQ > and fixed cor crysknives
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fine tune the balance on the Pw regen formula, especially
▒▒▒   as regards Sylphs.  See discussion in #nhfourk from Sunday,
▒▒▒   Feburary 5th, starting at 7:13, don't miss the late part
▒▒▒   of the discussion around 7:40.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rename the Valkyrie role to Shieldmaster/Shieldmaiden, and allow them to be any
▒▒▒   alignment (subject to race restrictions).  For race they can be human, valkyrie,
▒▒▒   or dwarf.  Make the valkyrie race always neutral female, dwarf always lawful male.
▒▒▒   Design the role to have less melee offensive power than e.g. Samurai or Barbarian,
▒▒▒   but better defense and some casting ability (e.g., cold).  Reflavor the quest text
▒▒▒   if needed (you may be coming to the aid of a group of warriors foreign to you;
▒▒▒   doing so at the behest of the Norn still makes flavor sense).  The cold res and
▒▒▒   flying are traits specific to valkyrie race: compensate non-valk shieldmasters.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Currently, do.c hardcodes the arrival-from-below region for the terminus.
▒▒▒   This is bad and not at all what I want.  Fix it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fix mazewalk so the same map-relative coordinates work regardless of the values
▒▒▒   of ROWNO and COLNO.  Fix the two Castles that were cherry-picked via BingeHack4,
▒▒▒   and re-enable them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * per rumflump, make #monster <direction> work for digging as a scurrier, so the user
▒▒▒   can dig things like a boulder or known-locked door without bumping into it first.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Let Samurai get expert in polearms, and put a naginata (glaive) in their magic chest.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making Snickersnee grant free action when wielded, or maybe stun res.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Your conscious should not "bother you a little less" if your alignment
▒▒▒   record is as high as it has ever been.  Change the wording in that case.
▒▒▒   Perhaps "You feel somewhat more [lawful/neutral/chaotic]."
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Cherry-pick FIQ's probabilty-1000 refactor, a0781683398ed and 162611e
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at and consider FIQ's autoswap feature, 719b864d5f
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check whether the FIQHack object pile implementation can be cherry-picked.
▒▒▒   Commits include: 73ca6d747f82, 4d16b6c, e3e43dc, f1c7504, b583fe6, 3ae61f0
▒▒▒   Semi-related:  4cfb84b
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 18:35 <        rumflump > would it be possible for floors that contain a vault, to auto-annotate when you see
▒▒▒                             "coins being counted"?
▒▒▒   18:36 <             FIQ > jonadab: ^
▒▒▒   18:36 <             FIQ > also for other kind of special [rooms]
▒▒▒   Answer: the obvious and clean way to do that is by tracking which level "sounds"
▒▒▒   the player has "heard", in the level data structure.
▒▒▒   07:13 <             FIQ > 5c3f742f18fdd791c91b0232cc413183ac23952b
▒▒▒   07:14 <             FIQ > adds a flag, and there was free space there
▒▒▒   07:14 <             FIQ > so I didn't even have to saveshim
▒▒▒   The FIQHack fix is for vault sounds only; I'd like to handle other level sounds
▒▒▒   in the same way.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at FIQ's ace9e3ba, which adds when-worn properties to several
▒▒▒   tools and also makes some interesting changes to cameras.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Reduce the weight of mithril armor.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Buff crystal plate mail in some way.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Item destruction rework:
▒▒▒   + Make extrinsic resistances protect against item destruction, including erosion.
▒▒▒   + Double check that fooproofing the item protects against item destruction.
▒▒▒   + Make sure potions of oil don't freeze in any case (but they can be lit by fire).
▒▒▒   + Make potions other than oil not boil/explode with fire (because cold shatters them).
▒▒▒   + Instead of exploding, wands should release a charge when shocked.  Depending on
▒▒▒     the type of wand, the charge may be activated rather than simply lost.
▒▒▒   + Instead of exploding, charged rings should lose a charge when shocked (unless at -3 or worse).
▒▒▒     I'll need to decide what to do about uncharged rings.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Nuke magic cancellation.  Test late-game balance with this change.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Finally have a decent plan for mummies.  See #nethack4 log from 2017 Apr 16, 18:45-18:50
▒▒▒   
▒▒▒ * The game should track what price quotes you've seen for a given item type.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 12:28 < FIQ > fu nfact: in fourk, sylphs at <12 constitution heal 1hp per turn in hell, at >=12 they don't heal at all
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Giants should have a better base AC than humans.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the ability for giants to wield two-handed weapons in one hand.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * It appears that material-sensitive players can wield weapons made of the
▒▒▒   material in question without difficulty or consequence, provided you do
▒▒▒   not change form _while_ wielding the item.  (This is true for silver
▒▒▒   in .4, and probably upstream even, but I want to fix it in a general way,
▒▒▒   not only for silver.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make the gameplay mode option not offer challenge mode until it's unlocked.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Bug: for non-setseed games, the seed reported in the xlogfile and dumplog is
▒▒▒   not actually the seed that was used.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * new monster: stinking sphere.  A sphere that releases a small-diameter
▒▒▒   stinking cloud when it explodes.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adjusting the difficulty of some monsters.
▒▒▒   + For example, quasits should probably have their difficulty number reduced.
▒▒▒   + Also manes.
▒▒▒   + Consider whether any very fast monsters need a bump because of that.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Ensure that runics interact reasonably with stacking.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make chameleons' ability to hold their form depend on how close it is to being
▒▒▒   level-appropriate:  short duration if it's much too high or low, longer if it's close.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * See lycanthropy discussion from 2016 Oct 25 in #nethack-dev, culminating
▒▒▒   around 20:00.  Short version:  make transformations happen less often,
▒▒▒   and make you invulnerable for a few turns after turning back to human,
▒▒▒   flavored as a fear effect.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * "thunderous voice booms through the caverns" could benefit from some
▒▒▒   conditional logic, e.g., outdoor levels should not be called caverns,
▒▒▒   nor likely should mazes...
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fix the bug wherein going into the options causes crashes.
▒▒▒   (This is believed to be related to achievement unlocking.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure monsters can't wear armor too large or small for them.
▒▒▒   (Not sure if boots and cloaks and gloves are handled yet.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Give each item a generation LEVEL, in addition to its frequency.
▒▒▒   Set it up so that the absolute value of the difference between an
▒▒▒   item's level and the current dungeon level determines the probability
▒▒▒   that mkobj (when deciding what to make at random) will reroll.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make pickup_thrown (at least optionally) work when autopickup is off otherwise.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When hallucinating, statues should appear to be monsters, and perform
▒▒▒   hallucinatory actions, such as singing, dancing, sneezing, etc.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Makedefs must die.  Make a list of all the things it does and triage
▒▒▒   when to refactor each of them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look into the "A a boulder bounces" bug (probably channelization-related).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Figure out what further buffs to do to martial arts, if any.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Add bears.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Create multiple versions of Delphi, with minor subtle differences.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Expand the number of versions of the Labyrinth just above the Castle,
▒▒▒   and make them more distinct from each other in some way (not the maze
▒▒▒   portion, but the special parts).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Add a couple new versions of the Garden.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Expand the numbers of versions of Yeenoghu's and Dispater's lairs.
▒▒▒   Or better yet, carry through on the original plans for randomness
▒▒▒   within them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Dream up another couple versions of Mine's End.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * K-Mod commits I might consider cherry picking:
▒▒▒   + Consider: d0c9cf1f691f (shopkeepers pick up gold they step onto)
▒▒▒   + Resistance vs Immunity, see also (part of) fac2c6dd7dd for poison res.
▒▒▒   + Two-weapon balance issues, see c20d51ca1c152cd7.
▒▒▒   + Two-handed weapon balance, see 4ff7364914cb46
▒▒▒   + Minor pickup_thrown bug, see dfddd28fdff213
▒▒▒   + Monster balance.  Balrog buff, see c4d52d7a9bf4a
▒▒▒   + Lava, see also 0580753ef5983, 56f511b72c36d
▒▒▒   + Items shouldn't spawn on holes, see 6381113dd84ba7
▒▒▒   + Player HP regen, consider 4ff7364914cb46 and maybe tweak.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Separate Def into distinct Arm (Armor) and Ev (Evasiveness) stats.
▒▒▒   Make Ev your chance to avoid being hit at all, and make Arm just be damage reduction.
▒▒▒   Some (heavy) armor would have an Ev penalty, so it's a trade-off; enchantment might reduce this?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the Middle Gehennom generator and Fire Pits.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Figure out which letter to clear for golems.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider implementing a couple of plants.  Look at the
▒▒▒   ones in dnethack and pick out the most interesting.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Are all the q really distinctive enough to stay?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * There really ought to be a second viable strategy (other than reflection)
▒▒▒   for dealing with an early black dragon.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Find a way to make zombies interesting, even if it's
▒▒▒   unbalanced and terrible and wrong.  They've been boring
▒▒▒   for too long, and we must overcome the inertia.  Maybe
▒▒▒   it'll be easier to steer them once they're moving.
▒▒▒   See discussion in #nhfourk from 2017 Feb 05, starting 06:58
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Do something about mummies.  See discussion in #nhfourk
▒▒▒   2017 Feb 05, starting 7:01
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement alternate versions of more special levels,
▒▒▒   including the Sanctum.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the nethack-mapgen-lower-mines-with-closets.pl algorithm.
▒▒▒   Use it sometimes (maybe 1/3) in deep Mines levels (last 2-3 levels
▒▒▒   before Mine's End).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement banshees
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Replace scroll of food detection with scroll of silence.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider changing the 18->18/**->25 progression for Str.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Track how much gold is generated, and diminish the amounts
▒▒▒   generated as the total increases.  Be stingier with monster
▒▒▒   inventory gold than floor gold (because the number of levels
▒▒▒   is strictly limited).  Consider also tracking the ultimate
▒▒▒   fate of gold by category (held by monsters, sitting on the
▒▒▒   ground somewhere, in a container, destroyed, etc.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make being stormprone work on monsters.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Giants should wield even two-handed weapons in one hand.  "You heft
▒▒▒   the mighty [weapon] in your hand.  Yes, that will do."  If it then
▒▒▒   gets cursed, it's welded to the hand, but the other hand is free.
▒▒▒   They can even use a shield in the other hand (but probably not
▒▒▒   another weapon, and certainly not another two-hander).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement sirens and banshees.  Place sirens in the Garden.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Import Aphrodite from a variant that has her, for her statue in the Garden.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * teach body_part about "teeth" (and fix the TODO in sounds.c).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at DynaHack's skill progress bars.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding a page to Ctrl-x with information about what
▒▒▒   is good and bad for your alignment record given your current
▒▒▒   race/role/alignment combination.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider, and if necessary tweak, the balance of speed.
▒▒▒   Also, make intrinsic and extrinsic and temporary speed stack
▒▒▒   for monsters, same as for players.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check whether the "You hear" part of the Valley arrival message checks deafness.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Put serious thought into giving the negative potions more uses than
▒▒▒   blanking.  After midgame, you always have far more holy water than you
▒▒▒   have any real use for, because far too many potions have no other real
▒▒▒   use.  This takes away the need for the player to decide how to use
▒▒▒   resources: you just blank all the useless potions and bless everything
▒▒▒   that could conceivably benefit from being blessed.  This should remain
▒▒▒   a possible strategy, but there should be other reasonable options.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making early-game poison instadeath, when you're too low-level
▒▒▒   to have a level drained, drain other stats instead, like HP, PW, Str, Con.
▒▒▒   FIQ says divine anger does this.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Eliminate the "snake" monster.  Consolidate water moccasins into pit vipers.
▒▒▒   Ensure none of the snakes are using red, black, or yellow as their color.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Perhaps cursed gain level should simply deposit you on the down stairs
▒▒▒   (of the level above) if you have the Amulet.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Improve the spoilers for playable races and roles, even if it means
▒▒▒   having a section written by hand.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at dnethack's skill progress indicators.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * After some players play .4 a bit, decide if the speed formulae
▒▒▒   require further revision for balance.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Racial-weapon chest contents (e.g., dwarvish spears if you are a dwarf)
▒▒▒   should probably be substituted out for something else if you are
▒▒▒   restricted in the corresponding skill.  For example, a Dwa Arc gets
▒▒▒   dwarvish spears but is restricted in them.  Either that, or else this:
▒▒▒   09:56 <      hackedhead > no. i mean, for every racial weapons that exists, the relevant
▒▒▒                             should be allowed to reach basic in the corresponding skill
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > so dwarves should be able to reach basic in spear, short sword.
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > orcs: dagger, spear, bow
▒▒▒   09:57 <      hackedhead > elves: dagger, spear, bow, broadsword
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Really, really ought to figure out how to make it so a special (.des) level's
▒▒▒   max x and y coords can be smaller than ROWNO and COLNO.  Levels that need this
▒▒▒   include the Castle (else you can bypass), Yeenoghu's (ditto), Dispater's (ditto),
▒▒▒   Creektown (with large ROWNO, the creek stops abruptly; with large COLNO, the
▒▒▒   pieces don't fit goether correctly), and probably some others.  Additionally,
▒▒▒   the BingeHack castles and one of the 3.6 Medusa levels trigger a place_lregion
▒▒▒   bug, and limiting their size might solve that too.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Quasits are still boring.  Do something.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make mvm and uvm poison instandeath work like mvp poison instadeath.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Give scurriers a movement point rebate when moving onto a tree tile.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 16:51 < FIQ > jonadab: your method of exposing traps with magic mapping will not work correctly on plane of water
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the Druid role.  Always neutral.  Human, possibly gnome.
▒▒▒   (I'd say dwarf if they could be neutral, but changing that seems not worth it,
▒▒▒   and lawful druid seems weird to me for some reason.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Should orcs have hooves, rather than feet?  (If so, should they be able to wear boots?)
▒▒▒   Should they have snouts, rather than noses?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Perhaps randomly-generated spellbooks should be biased toward low
▒▒▒   spell levels if generated on a low dungeon level.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make strange object m (in an otherwise unused color), then repurpose their
▒▒▒   former symbol for instruments.  Rework tools to avoid reusing colors more
▒▒▒   than is necessary.  FIQ has a start (which doesn't split off instruments
▒▒▒   and so probably needs tweaking), q.v. in my old TODO file on warthog.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 08:12 < FIQ > jonadab, certain forms of resistances should be foolproof in challenge mode too...
▒▒▒   08:12 < FIQ > e.g. taking fire damage as a fire vortex makes no sense
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * grep the codebase for TODO comments and deal with some of them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Jackals won't wade into shallow water to reach and attack me.  _Maybe_
▒▒▒   that's ok for jackals, but check that it doesn't happen for larger foes.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * For 4.3.0.4, I bumped monster HP regen from every 20 turns to every 8
▒▒▒   turns (commit 61efee7b811a93).  After .4 gets some play testing, evaluate
▒▒▒   whether this is enough (see FIQ's comments lower down about pets attacking
▒▒▒   floating eyes).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide what to do about hidden corridors and secret doors.  (Lots of ideas below.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider cherry-picking pool rooms from Dyna, and look at its special levels.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow fireproof scrolls to be wished for, and make them actually
▒▒▒   fireproof.  Ensure that blanking/writing don't alter their fireproof
▒▒▒   status.  Decide whether to allow creating them by any other means.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow any random object to be fooproofed when wielded, using a scroll
▒▒▒   of enchant weapon, in the same way as it is done for a weapon.
▒▒▒   Fooproofed items should be entirely protected from elemental damage
▒▒▒   (wetting/blanking, shock, fire, cold, etc.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make some (limited) armor that gnomes and scurriers can wear;
▒▒▒   consider doing the same for giants.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Revisit the sacrifice gift code's fallback options for armor, to
▒▒▒   ensure it can always find something size-appropriate.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement dress shirts, give them to librarians.  Consider what other
▒▒▒   equipment they should get.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding a ring of speed, as an alternative to speed boots.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Keep stats on how many game turns are spent on various multi-turn
▒▒▒   activities (digging, for instance).  Dumplog it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make potions of oil a bit more common, or put them in some monster's
▒▒▒   starting inventory, or something, so they can be used for weapon repair.
▒▒▒   Or introduce pools of oil so potions can be #dip-converted to oil.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make some weapon skills harder to learn than others, either in terms of
▒▒▒   practice required, or skill points invested, or both.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make katanas use a different skill from long swords.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the autounlock feature as in DynaHack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow hezrou to see through and in stinking clouds.  (Maybe give them intrinsic astral vision?)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look into probing schrodinger's cat (see comments below).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Add xlog and dumplog tracking for how many turns you suffered various
▒▒▒   status effects (blindness, hallucination, confusion, stunning), similar
▒▒▒   to conduct tracking but in a separate field.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make charged ring of searching increase your search radius.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make Valerian (and sleep in general) less OP somehow.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at how the lamp charging code manages to allow charging a lit
▒▒▒   lamp; use a similar toechnique to fix the issue of lit candles
▒▒▒   being impervious to fire damage.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Really really should enable highlighting of peacefuls to be disabled
▒▒▒   without turning off highlighting of pets.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * dnethack limits the number of pets you can keep to Charisma/3.  Consider
▒▒▒   whether something like this might be good (and maybe some roles or races
▒▒▒   should get a bonus, or take careful note of healer cha at least).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider how the Staff of Aesculalialdkjlaius should work for Sylphs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider creating a generalized version of rne that takes two integers representing
▒▒▒   a rational, so that fractions other than 1/n can be represented (e.g., 2/3).
▒▒▒   The regular rne() that is already widely used could be a wrapper that passes 1 for
▒▒▒   the denominator.  Consider using this function for things like random weapon
▒▒▒   enchantments, so that the probability of higher enchantments is a bit higher.
▒▒▒   Perhaps:
▒▒▒   static inline int
▒▒▒   rat_rne(int numerator, int denominator, enum rng rng)
▒▒▒   {
▒▒▒       int tmp = 1;
▒▒▒       if (numerator < 1)
▒▒▒          impossible("Numerator too small in rat_rne(%d, %d, %d)",
▒▒▒                     numerator, denominator, rng);
▒▒▒       else if (numerator >= denominator) {
▒▒▒          impossible("Numerator too large in rat_rne(%d, %d, %d)",
▒▒▒                     numerator, denominator, rng);
▒▒▒          return tmp;
▒▒▒       }
▒▒▒       while (tmp < 10 && (numerator - 1) <= rn2_on_rng(denominator, rng))
▒▒▒          tmp++;
▒▒▒       return tmp;
▒▒▒   }
▒▒▒
▒▒▒   static inline int
▒▒▒   rne_on_rng(int x, enum rng rng)
▒▒▒   {
▒▒▒       return rat_rne(1, x, rng);
▒▒▒   }
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making giantslayer a sling.  The wiki says Un does this.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Should sacrifice/prayer in Gehennom be subject to the InterHack principle?  (What actually happens?  How bad is it?)
▒▒▒   Ok, so first you get, "Since you are in Gehennom, [yourdiety] won't help you."  (IMO that should be "can't", but eh.)
▒▒▒   Then Moloch hits you with a standard you-prayed-with-a-too-high-prayer-timeout response,
▒▒▒   which can be e.g. a level drain, curse items, punishment, a hostile minion, etc.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the infrastructure for runic weapons:
▒▒▒   + Runics can be wished for in wizmode only.
▒▒▒   + Randomly generated weapons that are allowed to be artifacts but the
▒▒▒     RNG doesn't make them such, get a second chance to be runic instead.
▒▒▒     Any given weapon can have at most one rune.  Most have none, obviously.
▒▒▒   + Possible runes might include:
▒▒▒     - rune of fire (provides fire res when wielded; does fire damage; when dipped in shallow water, evaporates it)
▒▒▒     - rune of cold (provides cold res when wielded; does cold damage; when #dipped in a pool, moat, or shallow water, turns it to ice)
▒▒▒     - rune of poison (weapon is permanently poisoned and provides poison res when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of acid (weapon does acid damage and provides acid res when wielded and cannot be corroded)
▒▒▒     - rune of lightning (weapon does shock damage and provides shock res when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of accuracy (weapon never misses)
▒▒▒     - rune of peace (weapon always misses but also improves the odds that enemies/projectiles miss you, when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of magic (weapon does magic damage, like magic missile, and provides MR when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of action (weapon provides free action when wielded)
▒▒▒     - rune of blessing (weapon is permanently blessed and blocks the curse-items monster spell effect)
▒▒▒     - rune of damage (weapon does 1.5 times as much damage as it otherwise would)
▒▒▒     - rune of cancellation (weapon cancels monsters when it hits them, cancels potions when dipped in them, not using them up, except for holy/unholy water)
▒▒▒     - rune of rune of awareness (weapon grants automatic searching when wielded)
▒▒▒   + At game start, an array (probably in struct you) is populated providing a random rune appearance for
▒▒▒     each type of rune.  Identification of these is tracked: when you see a runic weapon activate, or if
▒▒▒     you formally identify one, its rune is identified.
▒▒▒     - Possible rune appearances include:
▒▒▒          glowing rune*, square rune, curved rune, angled rune, complex rune,
▒▒▒          strange rune, simple rune, elaborate rune, ornate rune, ancient rune,
▒▒▒          dwarvish rune*, gnomic rune*, dark rune, ominous rune, explicit rune,
▒▒▒          embossed rune, raised rune, seriffed rune, stylized rune, ugly rune,
▒▒▒          beautiful rune, straight rune, looping rune, unfamiliar rune, plain rune,
▒▒▒          circumscribed rune, obscure rune, gilded rune, magnificent rune, fancy rune,
▒▒▒          gaudy rune, convoluted rune, florid rune, portentious rune, grotesque rune
▒▒▒     - A weapon with a glowing rune provides light, with a small radius.
▒▒▒     - The identity of the dwarvish rune (if this appearance is assigned to a rune)
▒▒▒       is known from game start by dwarvish players.
▒▒▒     - The identity of the gnomic rune (same caveat) is known from game start by gnomish players.
▒▒▒   + Any weapon with a rune is described as "runed" normally, and the player can (attempt to) read it.
▒▒▒     (The player can also now attempt to read runed daggers, runed broadswords, and any other "runed" weapon.)
▒▒▒     - If the weapon has a rune that is known, reading the weapon tells the player something like
▒▒▒       "The rune signifies fire."
▒▒▒       This _does_ break illiterate conduct.
▒▒▒     - If the weapon has a rune that is unknown, reading the weapon tells the player something like
▒▒▒       "There is a glowing rune, but you do not know what it signifies."
▒▒▒       This does NOT break illiterate conduct.
▒▒▒     - If the weapon has no rune as such but is "runed" because Elven, and you ARE elvish by race,
▒▒▒       then reading the weapon tells the player something like this:
▒▒▒       "The runes mark this weapon as the craftsmanship of [Elven-sounding name]."
▒▒▒       This _does_ break illiterate conduct.
▒▒▒       The name of the craftsman can be determined by object ID and modular arithmetic, given a list.
▒▒▒     - If the weapon has no rune as such but is "runed" because Elven, and you are NOT elvish by race,
▒▒▒       the attempting to read the weapon tells the player something like this:
▒▒▒       "Elven runes run down the blade.  You cannot decipher their meaning."
▒▒▒       (The word "blade" may need to be %s if there are runed spears or whatnot.)
▒▒▒     - Weapons that do not have a rune and are not "runed" elven weapons cannot be read, as before.
▒▒▒   + 
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make the silly player-character ranks go away.  They don't add anything, and they
▒▒▒   confuse new players, needlessly, and they're so badly constructed (in terms of what
▒▒▒   the ranks are for each role) that they need a complete overhaul, which would only be
▒▒▒   worth doing if they contributed anything meaningful to the game, which they don't.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒   4.3.0.5 (can be after save-compat-freeze) :
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Reconsider unicorn horns.  Why do they heal raven blinding?  Why
▒▒▒   do they completely trivialize restore ability?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Per discussion in #hardfought on 2017 Apr 28, 7:38-7:47 am:
▒▒▒   + Make "You begin bashing monsters with your [nonweapon]" force more
▒▒▒     by default, if it doesn't already.  (Did this part 2017 August 25.)
▒▒▒   + Introduce a similar message for when you attack a monster with
▒▒▒     a weapon you're not skilled in.  Make the wording stronger if you
▒▒▒     are restricted than if merely unskilled.  Make it happen once on
▒▒▒     first hit, then not repeat until you wield again.
▒▒▒   + Make that message also force more by default, if not tab.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make the ais-enhanced A command that players can't figure out how to use die in a fire.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Hallucination should make umber hulk and medusa gazes ineffective and should
▒▒▒   block all touch-of-death (not just Death's).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make red scales grant fire resistance and sliming resistance.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 19:12 < FIQ > jonadab: 73e8721caf89aa966cdf03af258dde5374f33598 might interest you
▒▒▒   This is the thing that shows you your carry cap and total # of inventory slots in the sidebar.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at and consider cherry-picking FIQ's unskilled bashmsh, 7ad158a
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make the Wizard's Tower dragon hall have all colors of D.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Potions shouldn't be destroyed by fire attacks (because they're destroyed by cold attacks,
▒▒▒   and the player should be able to protect them with a single extrinsic resistance).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 02:06 #hardfought: <  LarienTelrunya > !tell jonadab at least in the bleeding-edge version of nethack fourk,
▒▒▒                                          "Dancing with Demiliches" medusa level gives two wands to one demilich and
▒▒▒                                           none to the other; not sure if that's a mistake, but I wanted to point it out :)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Limit a crystal ball's effective search radius based on intelligence.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 19:12 < FIQ > and ea76623be59adb32f24c1c4b197cc6815deab611
▒▒▒   This contains two things.  The one Fourk probably wants has to do with bags of holding auto-identifying
▒▒▒   when used.  Since object weights are shown, that makes sense on the InterHack Principle.
▒▒▒   The other half has to do with gaining/losing a property (regeneration, as it happens), and since
▒▒▒   a lot of property-related stuff is reworked in FIQHack I'd be hesitant to just blindly apply
▒▒▒   that part to Fourk, without carefully checking for implications.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ thinks Gnome darkvision should be able to see walls.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ suggests when pushing a boulder into (deep) water, sometimes shallow water should result.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Still need to squeeze a line or two out of the new ranger quest home, and rogue quest home.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Give elves lembas in the magic chest (FIQ's idea)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rethink quaff-identification deterrents.  In particular, should potions of hallucination
▒▒▒   really last that long?  (Mandevil complained about this; it _is_ basically forever.)
▒▒▒   Should potions of polymorph be more common?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Can mindless things sleep?  WHY can mindless things sleep?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 06:30 < FIQ > jonadab: maybe cursed remove curse should remove curses by destroying the cursed items
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance initial magic chest contents.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Grasshopper suggests club/mace/morningstar are basically the same skill, or should be.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Probably should suppress the "generate statues every time a cockatrice is
▒▒▒   generated" in cockatrice nests.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make it possible to trigger traps by throwing objects onto them.
▒▒▒   + arrow/dart trap: an arrow or dart shoots out in a random direction
▒▒▒   + falling rock trap: a rock falls
▒▒▒   + squeaky board: if the object is heavy enough, you hear a sound
▒▒▒   + bear trap: sets off the trap (equivalent to untrapping it)
▒▒▒   + land mine: explosion, of course (the object gets blown to a new location)
▒▒▒   + rolling boulder trap: duh
▒▒▒   + sleeping gas trap: flavor text and reveal if you can see the trap tile
▒▒▒   + rust trap: water damage the object
▒▒▒   + fire trap: fire damage the object
▒▒▒   + pit, spiked pit: object lands in pit, reveal pit
▒▒▒   + hole, trap door: object falls through, reveal trap door
▒▒▒   + vibrating square: object vibrates (reveal if you can perceive it)
▒▒▒   + teleportation trap: object teleports
▒▒▒   + level teleporter: object is levelported
▒▒▒   + magic portal: object goes through to other level
▒▒▒   + web: object gets stuck (this is purely flavor)
▒▒▒   + statue trap: statue comes to life
▒▒▒   + magic trap: ?
▒▒▒   + anti-magic field: if object is magical, umm, ?
▒▒▒   + polymorph trap: object is polymorphed; chance of using up the trap
▒▒▒   + stinking cloud trap: duh
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance spellbook frequency (now that the spellbook polymorph bug is fixed).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check the case of cursed-confused enchant armor on scaled armor.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Check the case of enchanting scales with no body armor under, while unchanging.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure blindness is handled correctly in read.c when applying sales to armor.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Runics: ensure that differently-runic items don't stack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Run the testbench and fix whatever it finds.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance spellbook prevalance.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Squeeze lines out of rogue quest home, ranger quest home.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making monsters more likely to generate asleep
▒▒▒   if they are higher-level (relative to your current monster
▒▒▒   level generation difficulty figure).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Fine-tune the balance of sleep, including Valerian, and
▒▒▒   of stealth.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider using the L Town generator (297 on Bilious) to
▒▒▒   generate the Black Market, perhaps.
▒▒▒   
▒▒▒ * Consider making the Mines below Minetown generate items
▒▒▒   of slightly higher quality than above Minetown.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When a shopkeeper pushes another monster out of the doorway in order to stand in it
▒▒▒   himself to block the player, he always calls the monster "scum", regardless of what
▒▒▒   kind of monster it is.  shk.c line 3656.  Investigate whether this can be improved.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Also, in 3.6, pay_for_damage() checks to see if the shopkeeper is an animal, and
▒▒▒   takes this into account in various ways.  Investigate whether I ought to cherry-pick
▒▒▒   some or all of that fix; if so, note that 5bb3e0142, already cherry-picked, interacts with it.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Rebalance body armor ACs and weights.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When stuck in lava, levitation should prevent you from sinking in any deeper.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ says that if you're level-drained below XL1, you can get something like
▒▒▒   "The vampire hits!  Do you want your possessions identified? [ynq]"
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Peaceful monsters encountering a player-made trap should not become
▒▒▒   angry if the trap can't have any impact on them (e.g., flying over
▒▒▒   a hole, spiders on webs).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adjusting the naming formula for randomly-named positively
▒▒▒   enchanted weapons.  hackedhead argues that "sword named Sword of Virtue"
▒▒▒   is terrible, breaks the fourth wall, doesn't scan right, and any other
▒▒▒   negative thing he can think of to say about it.  Admittedly, I can see
▒▒▒   how "a sword named Virtue" could be considered better.  Consider.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Evaluate whether chest traps need to be rebalanced.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement the monster-vs-monster side of passive displace (jitterbug), and maybe
▒▒▒   the monster-vs-player side as well (if I can think of a way to test that).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Report various levels of speed (including being slowed, or slowed and
▒▒▒   hasted, etc) reasonably in both enlightenment and end-of-game dumps.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make trollsbane turn gremlins to dust.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make dipping any negatively-enchanted thing in a potion of restore ability
▒▒▒   bring it up to +0.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Do a bunch of playtesting with steeds.  If they die all the time, figure out
▒▒▒   what to do about that.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Test using the PYEC to unlock stuff, see comments below.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * When rings go down a sink, something about the message ought to hint at the possibility of recovery.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make sure troll corpses aren't too old to eat before they're too old to revive.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Test attacking floating eyes as a raven, for message weirdness.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Helm of Opposite Alignment should never be given as a sacrifice gift, ever.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider guaranteeing a pick-axe in the Mines somewhere.  Maybe in Minetown.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Do a fresh batch of new Oracle and/or fortune cookie hints about new features,
▒▒▒   and review the existing ones for continued accuracy.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Update the guidebook.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒   Untriaged Stuff:
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 14:11 <     FIQ > jonadab: if you're going to do stuff like achievement tracking
▒▒▒   14:11 <     FIQ > you could also add stuff like tracking what kind of monsters players have met over time, etc
▒▒▒   14:11 <     FIQ > and tried out
▒▒▒   14:12 <     FIQ > and give that info if asked
▒▒▒   14:13 < jonadab > You mean like "You have encountered an Arch-lich 27 times in 23 games, vanquishing 8 of them"?
▒▒▒   14:14 <     FIQ > I meant more for taking notes for the player
▒▒▒   14:14 < jonadab > I don't think I understand.
▒▒▒   14:14 <     FIQ > if a player has eaten a shrieker corpse
▒▒▒   14:14 <     FIQ > and it gave poison res
▒▒▒   14:15 <     FIQ > the game will tell the player this if asked with extended info that they give poison res
▒▒▒   14:15 <     FIQ > in the future
▒▒▒   14:15 <     FIQ > stuff like that
▒▒▒   14:16 <     FIQ > you could then relegate stuff like poison/acid warnings to only show up if the player has seen it do this earlier
▒▒▒   14:17 <     FIQ > let players explore, let them find stuff out on their own
▒▒▒   14:17 <     FIQ > but keep track for the player
▒▒▒   14:18 <     FIQ > you could also do stuff like only letting people polyinit-play into creatures they've already killed at least once
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider replacing amulet of ESP with amulet of monster detection
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide whether to cherry-pick the vampire shapeshifter stuff (sans wolves)
▒▒▒   from the 3.6 series, with all its bug fixes, A) now, B) later, or C) never.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Haste self should give permanent, not temporary, speed.  Perhaps
▒▒▒   intrinsic at low skill levels, extrinsic or both at high levels.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Allow two-handed weapons to be enchanted to +10?
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Enchanting a weapon to +5 or higher should identify its enchantment level.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Should converting an altar grant an alignment bonus?  (hackedhead's idea)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * FIQ thinks Stacked Dozen should be a prize level due to difficulty.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make charisma have the opposite effect on shop quotes when you are
▒▒▒   both same-race and also same-gender to the shopkeeper.  (Maybe?)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide whether to implement some or all of my Alchemy proposal.  For feedback,
▒▒▒   https://www.reddit.com/r/nethack/comments/5e1taf/request_for_comments_solventsolute_alchemy/
▒▒▒   See also rgrn and my logs from #nethack-dev starting on 2016-Nov-20.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 20:32 < Grasshopper_ > YANI: blessed polymorph potion allows you to choose the poly form
▒▒▒   20:54 <      jonadab > You know, as rare as those are, I think that would actually be ok.
▒▒▒   But then I remembered, polymorph is a key deterrent to quaff-identifying potions.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * 13:06 < Chris_ANG > unfamilliar (and also familliar >_<) mosters turning
▒▒▒                       out to be a member of your own race has been a constant
▒▒▒                       problem in dNethack, right?
▒▒▒   13:07 < Chris_ANG > I'm going to make it so that a sufficiently-well-aligned
▒▒▒                       character gets a warning before doing something that
▒▒▒                       would result in canibalism or same-race sacrifice. 
▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒   4.3.0.6 or Later:
▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Track the player's alignment record separately for each of the three alignments,
▒▒▒   so that HoOA can be handled reasonably.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Hunger rework:
▒▒▒   + Rings of slow digestion and hunger are the same chargeable ring, with opposite
▒▒▒     charges.  Call it ring of digestion.  When positively charged, it speeds your
▒▒▒     digestion; when negative, it slows it.  Go ahead and let it protect against
▒▒▒     _being_ digested regardless of its charge/enchantment.
▒▒▒   + Things like spellcasting and teleportation no longer cause hunger.  The only
▒▒▒     way to hunger faster than usual is via a (positive) ring of digestion.
▒▒▒   + Tinning kits use charges proportional to corpse weight.  (This makes tinning dragons
▒▒▒     for their intrinsics more expensive.)
▒▒▒   + Intrinsics gained by eating now gradually time out.  Balance the rate of this
▒▒▒     so that eating food that does NOT grant intrinsics is almost always suboptimal
▒▒▒     strategy, because it means you'll end up bloated (or missing some resistance)
▒▒▒     or have to expend scrolls of charging on a tinning kit.
▒▒▒   + Make sure cursed food doesn't grant useful intrinsics.  (It may already not; check.)
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Bats should be able to echolocate around corners, up to some limited number of LOS bounces (maybe 3).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Clear up remaining niggles with the Garden implementation, see the
▒▒▒   commit log notes on commit commit 302d5fa9072.  Some of this may
▒▒▒   require levcomp overhaul and so may get pushed back further.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Make wielding and throwing separate skills for daggers and knives.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Instead of true/false, I want corridorbranch to be an enum:
▒▒▒      stop:  branching corridors stop movement (except targetted travel)
▒▒▒      stop_when_exploring (default): discovering a new branch stops movement;
▒▒▒                           but previously explored ones don't.
▒▒▒      keep_going: branching corridors do not interrupt movement.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Khor says, definitely look at the demon lairs in dnethack.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Move Nagas into S, freeing N for some other use.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider making diagonal movement between a pit or hole and
▒▒▒   something solid (such as a wall or boulder) cause you to fall
▒▒▒   into the pit or hole.  Revise the Count Carefully Sokoban
▒▒▒   level (and rename it).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Implement Un-style HTML dumplogs.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider how long potions of hallucination should last, and,
▒▒▒   if those are nerfed a bit, what other quaff-identification
▒▒▒   deterrents could supplement them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider changing the 18 -> 18/** -> 25 progression for Str,
▒▒▒   see comments lower in this file about that.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding an additional option for animation, to control
▒▒▒   the duration of the delay between frames.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Consider adding some kind of consolation special level that
▒▒▒   only generates when Ludios doesn't (accessible a different way).
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Think through possible uses of restore_attrib and the ability to
▒▒▒   _temporarily_ boost or penalize the users' attributes.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Decide what to do about Minetown rules -- monsters can freely do
▒▒▒   things that would anger the Watch if the player did them.
▒▒▒
▒▒▒ * Look at raisse's idea for a better Arc quest artifact,
▒▒▒   http://valdyas.org/~irina/stonecutter
